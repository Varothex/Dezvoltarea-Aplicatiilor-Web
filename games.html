			<h2>Marvel Future Fight</h2>

            <img src="/img/mff.png" style="height: 200px; float: right;" alt="Doctor Doom in MFF">
            <p>A brilliant scientist and one-time colleague of Reed Richards', Victor Von Doom's arrogance turned to unfettered megalomania when a lab accident scarred his face for life. Blaming Reed for his own mistake, Von Doom obsessively plotted his revenge, encasing himself in a suit of metal armor and brooding in secret. He staged a violent coup against his home country of Latveria, a small eastern European nation, and emerged as its new ruler, the dreaded Doctor Doom. From his throne, Doom enacts his diabolical machinations, slowed only by the valiant efforts of the Fantastic Four, as well as his own unbridled hubris.</p>

            <p>Leaving his tribe in Latveria, Victor Von Doom moved to the United States to study at the Empire State University where he combined sorcery and technology to create fantastic inventions. Disregarding the warnings of fellow classmate Reed Richards, one of his inventions malfunctioned resulting in an explosion that severely damaged his face. Expelled after the incident, Victor began traveling the world eventually collapsing exhausted, on a Tibetan mountainside where he was rescued by a clan of monks. Mastering their discipline and forging himself a suit of armor, Victor took on the mantle Doctor Doom, his mission to serve revenge on those he holds responsible for his accident.</p>

                    <p>Doctor Doom is a Mystic Champion <img src="/img/Mystic.png" style="height: 20px;" alt="mystic logo">. Being a Mystic Champion, he has a Class Bonus against Cosmic Champions, but is weak to Science Champions. He uses a combination of technology and sorcery to constantly push the battle in his favor. Doom’s sorcery abilities focus on controlling the fight and Nullifying Buffs. Doom’s technology abilities focus on raw damage and Debuffs. Combining both together allows Doom to decimate his opponent with little risk of repercussions.</p>

            <p>Doctor Doom is a Marvel Series Outfit in Fortnite: Battle Royale that can be obtained at Level 67 of the Chapter 2: Season 4 Battle Pass. Being the master of Arcane Arts and a supervillain in the Marvel Comics, Doctor Doom wears Titanium Armor that is nuclear powered and was created by a group of tibetan monks. His armor is cloaked with a green furry hood that makes him look more menacing. His God Emperor Style changes his armor to Gold and coat to white, thus turning him into God Emperor Doom, the ruler of a planet known as Battleworld in the Comics. His Foils change him into either Silver, Gold, or Rainbow and leave only his outlines visible. Doctor Doom (full name Doctor Victor Von Doom), along with many other marvel heroes and villains, was summoned by Thor to Apollo to help fight against Galactus. Shortly after Doom arrived, he took over Pleasant Park, and transformed it into Doom's Domain.</p>
